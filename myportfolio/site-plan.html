        Well, designing has been parts of my life as a Graphic Designer. So, after serving a mormon mission for two years.<br> 
        I made up my mind to pursuit a career in Web Design and Programming. But knowing this was not enough for me. This<br> 
        led me to study Business Administration and Management, to understand the visual and media elements of businesses.<br>  
        Afterword, studying Web Design and Programming.<br> 
        This phase of my life gives me the knowledge of an entrepreneur and small business owner. The struggles and<br> 
        challenges of developing a brand and positioning it on the internet through the best UI/UX for your website and<br>  
        graphic designs materials for your social media to compete with competitors. Finally, I will be privilege to use<br>
